# Middleware And Edge Runtime

- Use `middleware.ts` for route interception, authentication, redirects, and rewrites
- Use the Edge Runtime for faster startup and location-based personalization
- Handle cookies, headers, and dynamic rewrites in `middleware`
- Be mindful of constraints when running at the edge
