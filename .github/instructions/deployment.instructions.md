# Deployment

- Use Vercel for integrated features or self-host with Node or Docker
- Test SSR and static outputs thoroughly
- Run `prisma migrate deploy` before launch.
- Use CI/CD workflows for automated testing and deployment.
- Keep environment variables secure, never expose private values on the client
