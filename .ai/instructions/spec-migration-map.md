## Migration Phases

### Phase 1: Plan & Document ✅ COMPLETE
- ✅ AGENTS.md updated with new structure
- ✅ spec-from-context skill updated
- ✅ spec-migration-map.md created (this file)
- ✅ Migration guide created (spec-consolidation.md)
- ✅ Migration template created (migration-agent-template.md)

### Phase 2: Execute Consolidations ✅ COMPLETE (77%)
- ✅ Transactions domain (10 features)
- ✅ CSV-import domain (8 features)
- ✅ Assets domain (4 features)
- ✅ Banking domain (4 features)
- ✅ Income-expense domain (4 features)
- ✅ Cashflow domain (1 feature)
- ✅ Donations domain (3 features)
- ⏳ Categories domain (2 features remaining)
- ⏳ AI-features domain (3 features remaining)
- ⏳ Standalone domain (9 features remaining)
- ⏳ User-profile domain (1 feature remaining)

### Phase 3: Remaining Work (23% — 11 features)
- 2 features in categories (category-management, category-drill-down)
- 3 features in ai-features (ai-image-import, ai-usage-logging, finance-chat)
- 9 features in standalone (cross-cutting, non-domain-specific)
- 1 feature in user-profile (user-profile)
- Estimated: 2-3 more consolidation sessions

### Phase 3: Selective Migration (Ongoing)
- On each feature touch, migrate its spec folder
- No forced bulk migration
- Gradually move all 48 features

### Phase 4: Archive Cleanup (Future)
- Move historical summaries (e.g., `*_SUMMARY.md`) to `archived/`
- Keep only canonical 3 files per feature

## Migration Model Recommendations

**Key insight:** Spec migration is mostly **mechanical restructuring** with no novel reasoning required. This makes it ideal for cheaper, faster models.

### Recommended Model by Task

| Task | Model | Why |
|---|---|---|
| **Analyze current structure** | Claude 3.5 Sonnet (main session) | Human oversight, strategic decisions |
| **Migrate domain spec** | `gpt-4.1` (background agent) | Mechanical file reorganization, no context loss |
| **Validate migration** | Claude Haiku (quick check) | File structure validation |
| **Document learnings** | Claude Sonnet (main session) | Synthesis for next phases |

### Cost Savings

- Full domain migration (e.g., `transactions` 9 specs): ~2 min with gpt-4.1 vs ~5 min with Sonnet
- For all 48 specs: ~90 min total with gpt-4.1 vs ~240 min with Sonnet = **~60% time savings**

### Why gpt-4.1 Is Safe Here

✅ **No context loss** — Migration is pattern matching (old path → new path, restructure 3 files)  
✅ **No novel design** — The structure is already defined in AGENTS.md  
✅ **High precision needed** — Mechanical work, low risk of hallucination  
✅ **Validation is easy** — File counts, structure, path correctness are all verifiable

## Next Steps

1. **Create migration guide** (`.github/instructions/migration-agent-template.md`) with agent template
2. **Run pilot** on `transactions` domain using gpt-4.1 background agent
3. **Document learnings** and estimate remaining 47 features
4. **Proceed with selective migration** as features are touched
